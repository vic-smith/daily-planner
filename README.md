# Daily Planner

## The objective of this challenge was to create a time sensitive work day planner.

[Daily Planner](https://vic-smith.github.io/daily-planner/)

- The application consists of nine textareas that the user can add events to.
- Each timeslot has a color coded background to indicate whether the event is in the past, present, or future.
- The background color is updated to be consistent with the actual time using an if statement that changes the css class of each timeslot when iterated through a for loop on a one minute interval eliminating the need to refresh the page to update the schedule.
- User input is saved to local storage upon clicking the save button and reloads in the textarea on page refresh. (not currently working)
